RECORDit's really quite goodI like the way they did thatwhat a terrible way to end thingsleaves you wanting moredisgusting and unnecessary
whoa boy did I like this one
Iâ€™m not happy with how they ended that
great story; excellent execution
a stylistic tour-de-force
brilliant in every way possible
a sweeping score that takes you away
funny for the wrong reasons
wooden performances and an ugly script
