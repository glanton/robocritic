# data set parser; main purpose is to convert simple data to fully-featured data ready for
# training or classification
# expects 2 types of input data:
#   1) classified training set data consisting of a sentence and a class at each point
#   2) unclassified test data consisting of a sentence
# returns data, now with features


# public interface for parser; ultimately returns an updated list of lists
